\setabstract{
    The transversal nature of electromagnetic waves gives rise to a characteristic of light called polarization. It is by studying polarization that we can construct optical systems that enable physicists to exploit the wave nature of light. The following work aims to expose a complete process of characterizing the polarization state of a LASER beam. First, a brief framework is constructed on Polarization theory. 
    Then, characterization techniques are presented in a sequential way; building from linear to circular polarization.
