Light is a natural phenomena that can be manifested in many different ways. Depending on the state of the light, emergent phenomena like interference and coherence can occur. Furthermore, the practical applications of this phenomena yield excellent promising technologies that can be sized down down to the scale of nanometers. Therefore, it is very important to have characterization tools when dealing with optical systems given the many states of polarization a beam can have.\\


Thought this work, we exposed the principal characterization techniques when dealing with polarized light. Finally, the team concludes that  success-full measurements where obtained. The empirical characterizations exposed reinforced the contents discussed on the optical experimentation course.
