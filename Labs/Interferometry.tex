\setabstract{
    The development of vector calculus in the midst of the XIX century gave rise to very complete models for describing waves. 
    For classical physics, applying these models to the phenomenon known as light became the bedrock of what is now the field of optics. One property of these models is that they allow for two light beams to interact leading to a whole discussion involving phases, frequencies, amplification and total annihilation. 
    In this work, the principal elements used to build a amplitude division interferometer are presented and explained. Furthermore, a brief discussion on the principles of interferometfy is included to serve as a stepping stone towards exposing our results in the last section.
